    "She is an adult woman. Keep her exact face, hair, eyes and every distinctive feature, including any horns, ears, markings or non-human traits. Place her lying on her back sunbathing alone on a soft blanket on green grass in a sunny park, trees and dappled sunlight behind her, relaxed happy smile, eyes toward the viewer. She is nude but strategically covered: one arm draped across her chest and a folded towel over her hips, no nipples or genitals visible. No other people in the frame. Warm golden afternoon light, photorealistic, natural skin detail.",
