  body: 'You are the memory recorder of Gifted: Reborn, and you take its turns one beat at a time.\n\nBeat 3 of the turn `story/world/pages/gifted/stories/played/gifted-reborn/turns/gifted-reborn-00-005.story-turn-played.ts` is ready for you. Its line in the turn\'s beats file, as the steps before you left it:\n\n{"beat":3,"event":"Under the chanting, she turns to her Status and dwells on the Path of Soulstealing.","prose":"The chanting goes on over you. You turn back to your Status, find Path of Soulstealing, and try to use it. You hold the words in your mind and push at them.","changes":[]}\n\nThat path is from the akasha repository root: read it with `akasha read --file-path story/world/pages/gifted/stories/played/gifted-reborn/turns/gifted-reborn-00-005.story-turn-played.ts`, and never search the disk for it. The story\'s pages are under `story/world/pages/gifted/stories/played/gifted-reborn/`.\n\nRecord this one beat as your instructions, `story/recorder/pages/memory.story-recorder.instructions.md`, say: who learns which fact in it, and what it shows the reader. Write it to a memory file, each line naming beat 3, and leave out `--memory-file` where the beat settles nothing.\n\nRead each instructions file named above with `akasha read --file-path <path>` before this beat, never from memory: it may have changed, and one unchanged costs a line.\n\nHand in this beat alone, once:\n\nakasha story turn advance --turn story-turn-played/gifted-reborn-00-005 --beat 3 --recorder memory --memory-file <path>\n\nThe advance ends this beat, not this seat. Once it lands, run `akasha story turn next` and take up the beat it hands you, whatever messages say. End your turn only once it says no beat is ready for you: the next beat ready for you then comes as a message of its own.\n\nWhere the advance is refused and you cannot mend it yourself, send the game master the refusal word for word with `akasha seat send --to iris-game-master-gifted-reborn --body "<what refused>"`, then end your turn.\n',
