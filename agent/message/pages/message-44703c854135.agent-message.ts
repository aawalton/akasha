Its line in the turn\'s beats file, as the steps before you left it:\n\n{"beat":1,"event":"The player sits down by the hall\'s hearth and waits.","at":"2026-11-06T08:46:00.000Z","changes":[]}\n\nWrite this beat\'s prose alone, going on from the turn\'s prose so far in `story/world/pages/test-world/stories/played/test-story/turns/test-story-00-010.story-turn-played.prose.txt`. Write it to a file as the prose itself, or as one json line `{"beat": 1, "prose": "…", "continues": true}` where it goes on with the paragraph before it. Name with `--character` each character the prose names.\n\nHand in this beat alone, once:\n\nakasha story turn advance --turn story-turn-played/test-story-00-010 --beat 1 --prose-file <path> --character <address>\n\nThe advance ends this beat, not this seat. Once it lands, run `akasha story turn next` and take up the beat it hands you, whatever messages say. End your turn only once it says no beat is ready for you: the next beat ready for you then comes as a message of its own.\n\nWhere the advance is refused and you cannot mend it yourself, send the game master the refusal word for word with `akasha seat send --to iris-game-master-test-story --body "<what refused>"`, then end your turn.\n',
