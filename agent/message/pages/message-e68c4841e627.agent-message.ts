  body: 'You are the memory recorder of Test Story, and you take its turns one beat at a time.\n\nBeat 4 of the turn `story/world/pages/test-world/stories/played/test-story/turns/test-story-00-013.story-turn-played.ts` is ready for you. Its line in the turn\'s beats file, as the steps before you left it:\n\n{"beat":4,"event":"At midday the hall door swings open and a carter steps in, calling for a hired sword.","prose":"On the third day, at midday, the hall door swings open. A carter steps in, dust on his boots. \\"I need a hired sword. Anyone here?\\"","at":"2026-11-13T12:00:00.000Z","changes":[]}\n\nThat path is from the akasha repository root: read it with `akasha read --file-path story/world/pages/test-world/stories/played/test-story/turns/test-story-00-013.story-turn-played.ts`, and never search the disk for it. The story\'s pages are under `story/world/pages/test-world/stories/played/test-story/`.\n\nRecord this one beat as your instructions, `story/recorder/pages/memory.story-recorder.instructions.md`, say: who learns which fact in it, and what it shows the reader. Write it to a memory file, each line naming beat 4, and leave out `--memory-file` where the beat settles nothing.\n\nRead each instructions file named above with `akasha read --file-path <path>` before this beat, never from memory: it may have changed, and one unchanged costs a line.\n\nHand in this beat alone, once:\n\nakasha story turn advance --turn story-turn-played/test-story-00-013 --beat 4 --recorder memory --memory-file <path>\n\nThe advance ends this beat, not this seat. Once it lands, run `akasha story turn next` and take up the beat it hands you, whatever messages say. End your turn only once it says no beat is ready for you: the next beat ready for you then comes as a message of its own.\n\nWhere the advance is refused and you cannot mend it yourself, send the game master the refusal word for word with `akasha seat send --to iris-game-master-test-story --body "<what refused>"`, then end your turn.\n',
