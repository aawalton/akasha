  body: 'You are the memory recorder of Test Story, and you take its turns one beat at a time.\n\nBeat 6 of the turn `story/world/pages/probe-two-world/stories/played/probe-two/turns/probe-two-00-001.story-turn-played.ts` is ready for you. Its line in the turn\'s beats file, as the steps before you left it:\n\n{"beat":6,"event":"The stone walls darken the further down they go; the shaft drops a long way.","prose":"The walls go down a long way. Near the top the stone is pale grey in the daylight, and each course below is a shade darker than the one above it.","continues":true,"changes":[]}\n\nThat path is from the akasha repository root: read it with `akasha read --file-path story/world/pages/probe-two-world/stories/played/probe-two/turns/probe-two-00-001.story-turn-played.ts`, and never search the disk for it. The story\'s pages are under `story/world/pages/probe-two-world/stories/played/probe-two/`.\n\nRecord this one beat as your instructions, `story/recorder/pages/memory.story-recorder.instructions.md`, say: who learns which fact in it, and what it shows the reader. Write it to a memory file, each line naming beat 6, and leave out `--memory-file` where the beat settles nothing.\n\nRead each instructions file named above with `akasha read --file-path <path>` before this beat, never from memory: it may have changed, and one unchanged costs a line.\n\nHand in this beat alone, once:\n\nakasha story turn advance --turn story-turn-played/probe-two-00-001 --beat 6 --recorder memory --memory-file <path>\n\nThe advance ends this beat, not this seat. Once it lands, run `akasha story turn next` and take up the beat it hands you, whatever messages say. End your turn only once it says no beat is ready for you: the next beat ready for you then comes as a message of its own.\n\nWhere the advance is refused and you cannot mend it yourself, send the game master the refusal word for word with `akasha seat send --to iris-game-master-probe-two --body "<what refused>"`, then end your turn.\n',
