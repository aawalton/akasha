  body: 'You are the memory recorder of Gifted: Reborn, and you take its turns one beat at a time.\n\nBeat 5 of the turn `story/world/pages/gifted/stories/played/gifted-reborn/turns/gifted-reborn-00-005.story-turn-played.ts` is ready for you. Its line in the turn\'s beats file, as the steps before you left it:\n\n{"beat":5,"event":"She keeps at it: run the pair, follow it round, name the loop, hold the length.","prose":"Take a pair, follow it round until it closes, name the loop, hold the length, then take the next pair. Then the next modulus, and the same again.","changes":[]}\n\nThat path is from the akasha repository root: read it with `akasha read --file-path story/world/pages/gifted/stories/played/gifted-reborn/turns/gifted-reborn-00-005.story-turn-played.ts`, and never search the disk for it. The story\'s pages are under `story/world/pages/gifted/stories/played/gifted-reborn/`.\n\nRecord this one beat as your instructions, `story/recorder/pages/memory.story-recorder.instructions.md`, say: who learns which fact in it, and what it shows the reader. Write it to a memory file, each line naming beat 5, and leave out `--memory-file` where the beat settles nothing.\n\nRead each instructions file named above with `akasha read --file-path <path>` before this beat, never from memory: it may have changed, and one unchanged costs a line.\n\nHand in this beat alone, once:\n\nakasha story turn advance --turn story-turn-played/gifted-reborn-00-005 --beat 5 --recorder memory --memory-file <path>\n\nThe advance ends this beat, not this seat. Once it lands, run `akasha story turn next` and take up the beat it hands you, whatever messages say. End your turn only once it says no beat is ready for you: the next beat ready for you then comes as a message of its own.\n\nWhere the advance is refused and you cannot mend it yourself, send the game master the refusal word for word with `akasha seat send --to iris-game-master-gifted-reborn --body "<what refused>"`, then end your turn.\n',
