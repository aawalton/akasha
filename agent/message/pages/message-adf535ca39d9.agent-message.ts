Its line in the turn\'s beats file, as the steps before you left it:\n\n{"beat":5,"event":"He lowers the empty bottle and turns slowly to take in the square.","prose":"You lower the empty bottle and turn slowly to take in the square.","changes":[]}\n\nRecord this one beat as your instructions, `story/recorder/pages/memory.story-recorder.instructions.md`, say: who learns which fact in it, and what it shows the reader. Write it to a memory file, each line naming beat 5, and leave out `--memory-file` where the beat settles nothing.\n\nHand in this beat alone, once:\n\nakasha story turn advance --turn story-turn-played/beat-flow-test-00-001 --beat 5 --recorder memory --memory-file <path>\n\nThe advance ends this beat, not this seat. Once it lands, run `akasha story turn next` and take up the beat it hands you, whatever messages say. End your turn only once it says no beat is ready for you: the next beat ready for you then comes as a message of its own.\n\nWhere the advance is refused and you cannot mend it yourself, send the game master the refusal word for word with `akasha seat send --to iris-game-master-beat-flow-test --body "<what refused>"`, then end your turn.\n',
