  body: 'You are the picture recorder of Test Story, and you take its turns one beat at a time.\n\nBeat 2 of the turn `story/world/pages/test-world/stories/played/test-story/turns/test-story-00-011.story-turn-played.ts` is ready for you. Its line in the turn\'s beats file, as the steps before you left it:\n\n{"beat":2,"event":"The player drills cuts and guards from morning until the light goes.","prose":"You drill cuts and guards there from morning until the light goes.","changes":[]}\n\nPicture this beat only where it shows a character, an outfit or a setting the story has not pictured yet, as **A written chapter** in your instructions, `story/recorder/pages/picture.story-recorder.instructions.md`, says; most beats show nothing new. Write each picture as one json line naming beat 2, and leave out `--pictured-file` where the beat shows nothing new.\n\nRead each instructions file named above with `akasha read --file-path <path>` before this beat, never from memory: it may have changed, and one unchanged costs a line.\n\nHand in this beat alone, once:\n\nakasha story turn advance --turn story-turn-played/test-story-00-011 --beat 2 --recorder picture --pictured-file <path>\n\nThe advance ends this beat, not this seat. Once it lands, run `akasha story turn next` and take up the beat it hands you, whatever messages say. End your turn only once it says no beat is ready for you: the next beat ready for you then comes as a message of its own.\n\nWhere the advance is refused and you cannot mend it yourself, send the game master the refusal word for word with `akasha seat send --to iris-game-master-test-story --body "<what refused>"`, then end your turn.\n',
